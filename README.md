# About the bot
This Telegram bot is built using the aiogram and sqlalchemy frameworks (for the database). I also added greenlet and aiosqlite at the stage of launching the bot.
The work was done in VS Code.

The bot was created using: @BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather).
It has a unique link: @MindSET_toDo_bot (https://t.me/MindSET_toDo_bot)
It has the following functions: adding a new task and deleting it by closing the selected task.
